# Vanilla Calculator

A responsive plain Vanilla JavaScript, HTML & CSS calculator.

The idea here was to avoid using the JS eval() method at all costs, and this is the solution I came up with.

## Demo

You can try it out [HERE](https://it-drafter.github.io/vanilla-calculator/).

## Run Locally

Download .zip with all included files and folders, or clone the project instead:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/it-drafter/vanilla-calculator.git
```

To start using the calculator, simply run the index.html file in your favourite browser.

No installation needed.
